## Summary

This document defines the style guide for NexusL, covering naming conventions, triplet formatting, indentation, comments, and whitespace usage. The guide prioritizes readability, clarity, and consistency while drawing inspiration from modern language conventions such as JavaScript and Python, and honoring the expressive, nested nature of Lisp and the triplet model used in NexusL.

---

## Motivation

A clear and consistent style guide is essential for maintainability, readability, and collaboration—especially during early development. This guide seeks to Improve the overall clarity of NexusL code, encourage a consistent, modern syntax that’s easy to adopt. Align with contemporary language trends (e.g., camelCase) for developer familiarity and finally preserve the structure and expressiveness of triplets and nested logic.

---

## Detailed Specification

### 1. **Casing Conventions**

To maximize familiarity, brevity, and internal consistency:

#### • **Keywords:** `lowercase`

* **Usage:** All reserved words that define the core syntax (e.g., `if`, `do`, `let`, `may`, `hope`, `rule`, `assert_fact`, `retract`, `collect_all`, `trace`... and so on).
* **Rationale:** A near-universal convention across most programming languages. Easily recognizable and readable.
* **Example:**

  ```nexusl
  if (sensorReadings high) do (alarm activate);
  else do (status normal);

  robot may run how (fast (hope:0.80));
  rule:{
      parent is ?X ?Y
      if 
      ?X hasChild ?Y;
  }
  ```

#### • **User-Defined Constants:** `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

* **Usage:** For immutable values (e.g., `MAX_SPEED`, `PI_VALUE`, `DEBUG_MODE`).
* **Rationale:** A widely accepted convention to visually distinguish constants from variables or functions.
* **Example:**

  ```nexusl
  let MAX_RETRIES 5;
  Robot setSpeed MAX_SPEED;
  ```

#### • **Variables and Symbols:** `PascalCase`

* **Usage:** For variables, symbols, and query parameters (e.g., `MyRobot`, `CurrentLocation`, `SensorData`).
* **Rationale:** `PascalCase` is highly readable, space-efficient, and aligns with Go and many modern standards. It flows well within nested expressions and follows the Proper Noun idea.
* **Example:**

  ```nexusl
  ? Robot has:location CurrentLocation;
  fact (UserProfile has:name "Alice");
  ```

#### • **User-Defined Predicates / Actions / Functions:** `camelCase`

* **Usage:** For user-defined predicates, agent actions, or functions (e.g., `moveTo`, `reportStatus`, `calculateDistance`).
* **Rationale:** Using `camelCase` consistently across identifiers provides visual harmony and reflects patterns from JavaScript, Kotlin, and other contemporary languages. It avoids the visual clutter of underscores in deeply nested expressions.
* **Example:**

  ```nexusl
  Robot move to:kitchen;
  Agent reportStatus to:dashboard;
  rule:{  
      is:validUser ?:User
      if ?:User hasRole "admin"
  };
  ```

---

### 2. **Triplet Formatting and Nesting**

* **Triplets:** Prefer one triplet per line, terminated with a `;`.

  * **Example:** `subject predicate object;`
* **Nesting:** Indent nested expressions using 2 or 4 spaces per level for clarity.

  * **Example:**

    ```nexusl
    Robot do (
        move to:bedroom
    );

    rule (isComplex ?item) if (
        ?item has:value (
            nestedStructure ( key "example" )
        )
    );
    ```

---

### 3. **Comments**

#### • **Single-line comments:** Use `//` for short inline or standalone comments.

* **Example:**

  ```nexusl
  Robot reportStatus; // Reports the current status
  ```

#### • **Multiline comments / Docstrings:** For module or function documentation, use block comment delimiters like `""" ... """` or `/* ... */` (once supported).

* **Example:**

  ```nexusl
  """
  Controls robot movement and position tracking.
  """
  module robotMovement {
      // ...
  }
  ```

---

### 4. **Whitespace Usage**

* Add spaces around operators and delimiters for readability.

  * **Preferred:** `value > 80;`
  * **Avoid:** `value>80;`

---

## Rationale

Adopting `camelCase` across user-defined identifiers improves visual clarity in nested triplet structures and aligns with conventions from widely used languages like JavaScript, Java, and Kotlin. It reduces the visual noise of underscores while keeping names compact and expressive. This style guide is foundational for future tooling, including linters, formatters, and documentation generators.

## Alternatives Considered

* **snake_case:** Rejected for its bulkiness in nested expressions and reduced visual cohesion in complex triplet chains.
* **kebab-case:** Rejected to avoid conflicts with syntax involving hyphens or operators.
* **Lisp-style lowercase with dashes:** Rejected to keep NexusL more accessible to developers from mainstream programming backgrounds.

---

## Compatibility Impact

As an informational document, this PENx has no effect on NexusL's execution behavior but may guide future tooling (parsers, linters, formatters).

---

## Implementation (Optional)

* Store this document in `docs/penx/PENx25-002.md`.
* Refer to it from `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
* Incorporate its rules into early tooling and test suites as style-check mechanisms.

---

## Open Questions

* Should the style guide evolve into a formal standard enforced by the compiler or remain advisory?
* Will exceptions to the casing rules be allowed (e.g., for interoperability with external systems)?
* How should this style guide apply to auto-generated code from AI agents?
