# Logbook

Passing some days, within starting by 4 th time. I decide to maintain a logbook in order to keep the consistency on the workflow. This is only a hobby lang but now i can imagine as a project in order to achieve my Associate degree; maybe not the lang as is, but the process could be helpful.

At this time i achieve the backtracking and a optimization algorithms for the logical engine with the help of le chat, gemini and chatgpt. They aren't too much intelligent finally, apparently they are incapable of make generalizations, that's good because that help me to learn instead to only copy code.

At this time i understand that the basic engine could be provided in GO, but the advanced process need to be build over nexusL; that is necessary because the complex restrictions need to be "in the language", in order to avoid external lang blocks.

- in the file [250620_IR](/Users/davidochoacorrales/Documents/GitHub/nexusl/docs/logBook/250620_IR.md) I copy the chat with chatGPT and gemini. Le chat simply doesn't understand anything. As conclusion:
    1. Because i provide a logical engine and load the state of the program (all triplets) on memory when the program starting. It's faster use GO + Bbolt instead Nim + cozoDB.
    2. The intension of build a intermediate structure (as intermediate lang) is feasible and powerful in order to provide a platform for several implementations: NET (corporative), wasm (web), and so on.
    3. the sea of nodes provide a framework for optimization pre-compilation
