## 1. Data Preparation (`preIngest`)


This section details the initial step in building or updating NexusL's knowledge base for the RAG system. The `preIngest` process transforms raw, human-readable source documents into a structured **JSON Lines (JSONL)** format. These JSONL files are then ready for the next `ingest` phase, where embeddings are generated and stored.

### 1.1 Purpose

The primary goal of the `preIngest` process is to convert unstructured text content into a standardized, machine-readable format. This involves:

* **Chunking:** Breaking down large documents into smaller, semantically meaningful pieces (chunks).
* **Metadata Extraction:** Identifying and associating key information (like source file, section heading, page number, tags) with each chunk.
* **Unique Identification:** Assigning a deterministic, content-based ID to each chunk.
* **Standardization:** Ensuring all processed data adheres to the `Chunk` JSON structure for consistent downstream processing.

### 1.2 Input File Format

The `preIngest` tool expects your raw source documents to follow a specific delimited format. Each chunk must be clearly marked with `---CHUNK_START---` and `---CHUNK_END---` delimiters, and metadata fields should use a `key: value` syntax.

**Example Input File (`source_of_truth.txt`):**

```
---CHUNK_START---
source_file: nexusl_documentation_v1.0.txt
section_heading: Introduction to NexusL Triplets
page_number: 5
language: en
group: core_concepts
tags: lisp, rdf, triplets, json-ld
content_start
NexusL is a Lisp-inspired language built on the concept of triplets (Subject Predicate Object).
This design allows for a dynamic knowledge base, where relationships are explicit and extensible.
It is particularly suited for intelligent agents.
content_end
---CHUNK_END---

---CHUNK_START---
source_file: nexusl_documentation_v1.0.txt
section_heading: Agent Actions
page_number: 7
language: en
group: advanced_features
tags: agents, actions, swrl, owl-s
content_start
In NexusL, actions can be represented as triplets where the object is a function or an instruction.
For example, (robot move (to (room bedroom))) combines declarative facts with executable actions,
a powerful paradigm for intelligent agent control.
content_end
---CHUNK_END---
```

### 1.3 Output File Format

The output of the `preIngest` process is a **JSON Lines (JSONL)** file. Each line in this file is a valid JSON object representing a `Chunk`. This format is optimized for streaming and efficient processing by the `ingest` tool.

**Example Output File (`processed_chunks.jsonl`):**

```json
{"content":"NexusL is a Lisp-inspired language built on the concept of triplets (Subject Predicate Object).\nThis design allows for a dynamic knowledge base, where relationships are explicit and extensible.\nIt is particularly suited for intelligent agents.","group":"core_concepts","id":"a1b2c3d4e5f67890..." /* shortened SHA256 hash */,"language":"en","page_number":"5","section_heading":"Introduction to NexusL Triplets","source_file":"nexusl_documentation_v1.0.txt","tags":["lisp","rdf","triplets","json-ld"]}
{"content":"In NexusL, actions can be represented as triplets where the object is a function or an instruction.\nFor example, (robot move (to (room bedroom))) combines declarative facts with executable actions,\na powerful paradigm for intelligent agent control.","group":"advanced_features","id":"f0e9d8c7b6a54321..." /* shortened SHA256 hash */,"language":"en","page_number":"7","section_heading":"Agent Actions","source_file":"nexusl_documentation_v1.0.txt","tags":["agents","actions","swrl","owl-s"]}
```

### 1.4 How to Run

The `preIngest` tool is a command-line utility.

1.  **Navigate to the `preIngest` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd nexusL/rag/preIngest
    ```

2.  **Ensure Environment Variables are Set:**
    The tool requires the following environment variables to be configured, typically in a `.env` file located at `/Users/davidochoacorrales/Documents/GitHub/nexusl/rag/env/.env`:
    * `SOURCE_TRUTH`: The full path to your input raw text file (e.g., `path/to/my_documentation.txt`).
    * `CHUNKS_FILE`: The full path where the output JSONL file will be saved (e.g., `path/to/processed_chunks.jsonl`).

    Example `.env` content:
    ```dotenv
    SOURCE_TRUTH=/Users/youruser/Documents/nexusL/docs/raw_documentation.txt
    CHUNKS_FILE=/Users/youruser/Documents/nexusL/rag/processed_chunks.jsonl
    ```

3.  **Run the `preIngest` executable:**
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    # Or, if you've built the executable:
    # ./preIngest_executable
    ```

### 1.5 Troubleshooting

* **"Warning: Could not load configuration file..."**: This indicates the `.env` file was not found or accessible. Ensure the path in `main.go` (`configFile`) is correct or that environment variables are set directly.
* **"Error: Environment variable SOURCE_TRUTH / CHUNKS_FILE is not set..."**: The required environment variables are missing. Double-check your `.env` file or shell environment.
* **"Error during chunk parsing..."**: This suggests an issue with reading the input file or a malformed chunk within it. Review your `SOURCE_TRUTH` file for correct delimiters and syntax.
* **Empty output file or no chunks processed**: Verify that `---CHUNK_START---` and `---CHUNK_END---` delimiters are correctly matched and that content/metadata sections are properly formatted.
