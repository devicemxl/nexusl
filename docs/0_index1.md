1. Understand the Basics of Triplets and RDF
Task	Description
Study Triplets	Learn about the subject-verb-object structure of triplets.
Study RDF	Familiarize yourself with the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and how it uses triplets.
Read Resources	Books, online tutorials, and academic papers can provide a solid foundation.
2. Define the Core Data Structures for Triplets
Task	Description
Triplet Structure	Define a structure to represent a triplet (subject, verb, object).
Entity Structure	Create a structure for Entities with UUID, name, properties, and procedures.
Property Structure	Define structures for properties with name and value.
Procedure Structure	Define structures for procedures.
3. Design the Knowledge Base
Task	Description
Storage	Decide how to store triplets efficiently.
Indexing	Implement indexing mechanisms for quick lookup of triplets.
Modification	Provide methods to add, remove, and update triplets.
4. Implement the Parser for Triplets
Task	Description
Lexical Analysis	Tokenize the input text into subjects, verbs, and objects.
Syntactic Analysis	Parse the tokens into triplet structures.
Semantic Analysis	Validate the triplets and build the internal representation.
5. Develop the Inference Engine
Task	Description
Resolution	Implement the resolution strategy for triplets.
Goal Processing	Handle the processing of goals and subgoals using triplets.
Rule Application	Apply rules represented as triplets to derive new facts.
6. Add Query Processing
Task	Description
Query Parsing	Parse user queries into triplet-based internal representations.
Query Execution	Execute queries against the knowledge base of triplets.
Result Handling	Collect and present the results of the queries.
7. Implement Persistence with Bbolt
Task	Description
Bbolt Integration	Set up Bbolt for persistent storage.
Store Triplets	Implement methods to store and retrieve triplets from Bbolt.
Store Entities	Implement methods to store and retrieve Entities, properties, and procedures from Bbolt.
Store States	Implement methods to store and retrieve states from Bbolt.
8. Add Macros and Meta-Programming
Task	Description
Compile-Time Macros	Implement macros that are expanded during compilation.
Runtime Macros	Implement macros that can be expanded on the fly using information from the knowledge base.
Meta-Programming	Ensure that code is data and data is code, allowing for flexible meta-programming.
9. Implement the Transpiler
Task	Description
Transpiler Design	Design the transpiler to convert your DSL into Go code.
Transpiler Implementation	Implement the transpiler, ensuring it handles triplets, Entities, properties, and procedures correctly.
Testing	Thoroughly test the transpiler with various cases.
10. Add User Interface
Task	Description
CLI	Create a command-line interface for interacting with the engine.
API	Develop an API for programmatic access to the triplet-based knowledge base.
GUI	Optionally, create a graphical user interface.
11. Testing and Debugging
Task	Description
Unit Tests	Write unit tests for individual components.
Integration Tests	Test the interaction between different components.
Debugging Tools	Develop tools to help debug and trace the execution of triplet-based logic.
12. Documentation
Task	Description
Code Documentation	Document the code with comments and docstrings.
User Manual	Write a user manual explaining how to use the framework.
Examples	Provide example programs and queries using the triplet-based DSL.
13. Community and Contributions
Task	Description
Open Source	Consider open-sourcing the project to attract contributors.
Community Building	Build a community around the project through forums, social media, and conferences.
Continuous Improvement	Continuously improve the framework based on user feedback and contributions.

By following this pathway, you should be able to develop a logical framework in Go that uses triplets for representation and meets your specific requirements. Good luck with your project!
