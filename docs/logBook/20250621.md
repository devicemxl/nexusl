# Lexer explorations

After a long talk with several LLMs and some explorations at reddit, stackoverflow, softwareengineering@stackexchange, geeks for geeks and so many others. I decide to follow the "Build Your own lisp" approach: parse complete "words", whatever that means. And after then, the next path:

1. write a regular expression specification
2. a hand-written table/switch driven lexer.
3. So also for the parser (a simple Recursive Descent parser).

```t
As simple note at this point:

The LLMs fortunately are in a "cycle" they has an idea of nexusL after sever talks and make exactly that they "think" as needed for the drew path; then they make only very specific functions and i need to refactoring it, this add a lot of power and flexibility to my work because i understand how to use as assistants more than a code producers. As a "megaphone" for my ideas.
```

## Step One

split a line into a list of words:

```go

words := strings.Fields(line)

fmt.Printf("Original string: %q\n", line)
fmt.Printf("Split words: %q\n", words)

```

and after that, i split several lines with a loop:

```go
// package Lexer

func StepOne(line string) []string {

	words := strings.Fields(line)

	//fmt.Printf("Original string: %q\n", line)
	//fmt.Printf("Split words: %q\n", words)
	return words
}

// package main

func main() {
	multilineString := ` David is symbol;
	// Hello, world! This is a comment.\n Let's "see how" it works.
	Hola,
Este es un string
que ocupa varias líneas.// este es un comentario too
Incluso puedes incluir
  espacios al principio de las líneas.`
	//
	// Create a new scanner to read the string line by line
	// strings.NewReader converts the string into an io.Reader,
	// which bufio.Scanner can then read from.
	lineNumber := 1
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(strings.NewReader(multilineString))
	// Step Ones
	for scanner.Scan() {
		lineNumber++
		line := scanner.Text()
		//var theText = line
		var dx = lx.StepOne(line)
		fmt.Printf("Split words: %q\n", dx)
	}

}
```
that produces something like:

```t
Split words: ["Hello," "world!" "This" "is" "a" "test.\\n" "Let's" "\"see" "how\"" "it" "works."]
Split words: ["Hola,"]
Split words: ["Este" "es" "un" "string"] ...
```

## Step Two

The first and most basic structure in nexus is a simple triplet: a b c;

then i build a the lexer rules following the nexusL lang spec.
