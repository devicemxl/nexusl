## **1. Title**

Configurable Meta-model for NexusL: Enabling Dynamic Definitions of Scopes, Triplet Types, and Core Predicates via "Liquid" Configuration.

## **2. Abstract**

This document outlines a design proposal to decouple core linguistic definitions (such as TripletScope types, fundamental Symbol types, and built-in Macro predicates) from the NexusL compiler's hardcoded logic. By implementing a "liquid" or configurable metamodel, NexusL will gain significant flexibility, allowing users to define and extend its semantic foundation externally, facilitating the creation of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and dynamic agent behaviors.

## **3. Introduction**

The initial design of NexusL's core Symbol and Triplet structures provides a robust foundation for representing knowledge and actions. However, to enhance extensibility and adaptability—crucial for an agent-oriented language—the definitions of fundamental elements like fact, func, def scopes, and base Symbol types (e.g., "Thing", "MetaType") should not be fixed within the compiler's source code. This PEN proposes an architecture where these definitions are loaded from external configuration, transforming them into "liquid" components of the NexusMesh.

## **4. Problem Statement**

Current compiler design often hardcodes core language constructs, requiring recompilation for semantic extensions. For NexusL, where dynamic knowledge representation and agent adaptability are paramount, this rigidity limits:

* The easy definition of new TripletScopes by users.  
* The extension of core Symbol Thing types without compiler changes.  
* The ability to load different "ontologies" or metamodels based on runtime context.  
* The long-term vision of NexusL being self-extensible.

## **5. Proposed Solution: The "Liquid Metamodel"**

We propose implementing a configurable metamodel, where fundamental NexusL definitions are sourced from external files rather than being entirely internal to the Go compiler.

### **5.1 Key Concepts**

* **External Definition Files:** Core TripletScopes, base Symbol Thing types, and the association of Macro names with their built-in Go expansion procedures will be defined in external, easily parseable files (e.g., JSON, YAML, or eventually a subset of NexusL itself).  
* **Initialization Module (in Go):** A dedicated module within the Go compiler will be responsible for reading these definition files during the compiler's bootstrap phase.  
* **Dynamic Symbol Registration:** This module will parse the external definitions and programmatically create and populate the global Symbol maps (SymbolsByID, SymbolsByPublicName) with the necessary Symbol instances for each defined scope, type, and macro.  
* **Proc Assignment:** For built-in Macros (like fact, func, def), the Symbol instance created from the external definition will have its Proc field assigned to the corresponding Go expansion function (which remains hardcoded in Go for performance and security reasons).

### **5.2 Architectural Flow**

1. **Lexer (Go):**   
   * Processes raw NexusL source code into tokens, including identifiers for scopes and macros.  
2. **Definition Loading (Go):**   
   * Before parsing, a dedicated Go module reads external definition files. It populates the global SymbolsByPublicName map with Symbol instances representing TripletScopes (e.g., a Symbol named "fact" with Thing: "TripletScope" and Value: TripletScope.Facts) and Macros (e.g., a Symbol named "fact" with Thing: "Macro" and Proc: ExpandFactMacro).  
3. **Parser (Go, First Pass):**   
   * Consumes tokens and constructs an **initial "sea of nodes" (a dependency graph)**. Instead of a strict hierarchical Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), the parser will build a graph where `Symbol`s are nodes and `Triplet`s (or their components) represent relationships or operations. When encountering `(fact ...)`, it recognizes "fact" via `SymbolsByPublicName` as a `Macro` and creates corresponding nodes/edges in the graph representing this macro call.  
4. **Macro Expander (Go):**   
   * Traverses the AST. Upon finding a "Macro Call Triplet," it invokes the Proc (Go function) associated with the Macro Symbol. This Proc generates a new, expanded AST fragment (a Triplet with the correct Scope assigned from the loaded Symbol). The original macro call is replaced by the expanded AST. This process is recursive until all macros are expanded.  
5. **Semantic Analysis & Transpilation (Go):**   
   * The fully expanded AST (comprising Symbols and Triplets with dynamically assigned Scopes) is then processed for semantic checks and transpiled into Nim (or other target languages).

## **6. Benefits**

* **Enhanced Extensibility:** Users can define custom TripletScopes, Thing types, and even new built-in Macros by modifying external files, without altering or recompiling the core NexusL compiler.  
* **Domain-Specific Language (DSL) Creation:** Facilitates the rapid prototyping and evolution of DSLs built atop NexusL by allowing users to tailor its fundamental semantic building blocks.  
* **Dynamic Loading of Ontologies:** Enables the loading of different metamodels or ontologies at runtime or compile-time based on application context, crucial for adaptive intelligent agents.  
* **Simplified Maintenance:** Updates to semantic definitions no longer require recompiling the entire compiler stack.  
* **Future Self-Extensibility:** Lays the groundwork for NexusL to eventually define and modify aspects of its own metamodel from within NexusL itself.

## **7. Implementation Strategy**

* **Definition File Format:** Initially, we will use a simple, parseable format (e.g., a custom JSON structure) for definition files. This will evolve towards a subset of NexusL itself as the parser matures.  
* **Dedicated Go Module:** Create a ds/definitions.go (or similar) module to handle reading and parsing these external files, and populating the global Symbol maps.  
* **Proc Stubbing:** Initially, the Procs for built-in macros will be simple Go functions. Their full implementation will follow once the parser and AST manipulation capabilities are more mature.  
* **Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests for the definition loading module will ensure Symbols are correctly created and registered. Integration tests will verify that the parser and macro expander correctly interpret and utilize these dynamically loaded definitions.
