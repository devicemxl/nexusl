# NexusL in Plain English

Working within nexusL & LLMs enables pass from that the LLMs do, to what an agent needs to do, because "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts".

LLMs are incredibly powerful at understanding and generating language, but they lack a robust model of the world and the ability to directly interact with it in a consistent way. This is where NexusL, with OWS-S's Service Profile, Service Model, and Service Grounding, can fill that gap and be the "intelligent glue" that transforms LLMs into truly powerful tools for people.

Integrating the concepts of Service Profile, Service Model, and Service Grounding into NexusL is not only a valuable path, but essential to the vision. It's how NexusL can give the LLM "tools" that it truly understands semantically, not just JSON to call an API; it can manage the state of the world in a consistent and persistent way, something LLMs don't do.

It would make it possible to provide reasoning and planning capabilities (thanks to rule, infer, goal, plan) that go beyond the "token generation" of an LLM and allow the LLM to focus on language and high-level reasoning, while NexusL handles precise and semantically rich interaction with the digital and physical world.

This is established as a vision and an urgency to set up this as a primary objective for NexusL. Overcoming "Potemkin understanding" and the anecdotes of the Atari 2600 beating LLMs at chess highlight the crucial difference between text/pattern generation (what LLMs do) and reasoning, planning, and action based on a model of the world (what an agent needs to do).

nexusL â€” Because the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
